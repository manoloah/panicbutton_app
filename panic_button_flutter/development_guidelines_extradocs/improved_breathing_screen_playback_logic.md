# Improved Breathing Screen Playback Logic

This document details the comprehensive improvements made to the breathing screen audio playback system to resolve mobile audio loading and playback issues.

## Overview

The breathing screen audio system experienced significant issues on mobile devices, particularly iOS, where voice prompts and instrument cues were failing to load with errors like "Operation Stopped" and "asset does not exist." This document outlines the systematic fixes implemented to create a robust, reliable audio experience.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Asset Path Problems
- **Voice Prompts**: Directory structure mismatch between code expectations and actual file organization
- **Instrument Cues**: Incorrect asset path construction causing file not found errors
- **General**: Inconsistent asset path handling across different audio types

### 2. iOS Audio System Conflicts
- **"Operation Stopped" Errors**: Frequent PlatformException(-11849) when trying to play audio
- **Resource Conflicts**: Audio players interfering with each other during rapid phase transitions
- **Timing Issues**: Insufficient delays between audio operations causing iOS to reject new playback requests

### 3. Directory Structure Mismatch
- **Expected**: `pauseAfterInhale`, `pauseAfterExhale` (camelCase)
- **Actual**: `pause_after_inhale`, `pause_after_exhale` (snake_case)
- **Impact**: Voice prompts failing to load entirely

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Asset Path Resolution

#### Voice Prompts Fix
**Problem**: The code was looking for `pauseAfterInhale` but files were in `pause_after_inhale`

**Solution**: Added automatic camelCase to snake_case conversion:
```dart
// Convert phase name to directory structure format
String phaseName = phase.toString().split('.').last;
// Convert camelCase to snake_case for directory names
phaseName = phaseName.replaceAllMapped(
  RegExp(r'([A-Z])'),
  (match) => '_${match.group(1)!.toLowerCase()}',
);
// Remove leading underscore if present
if (phaseName.startsWith('_')) {
  phaseName = phaseName.substring(1);
}

// Build the asset path with correct directory structure
final assetPath = 'assets/sounds/guiding_voices/$voiceId/$phaseName';
```

**Result**: Voice prompts now correctly map to actual file locations:
- `BreathVoicePhase.pauseAfterInhale` → `pause_after_inhale`
- `BreathVoicePhase.pauseAfterExhale` → `pause_after_exhale`

#### Instrument Cues Fix
**Problem**: Asset paths were missing the `assets/` prefix required by Flutter's asset system

**Solution**: Corrected asset path construction:
```dart
// Build the asset path (correct prefix for setAsset)
final assetPath = 'assets/sounds/instrument_cues/$instrumentName/${phaseName}_$instrumentName.mp3';
```

**Result**: Instrument cues now load correctly with proper Flutter asset paths.

### 2. iOS Audio System Compatibility

#### Enhanced Retry Logic
**Problem**: iOS audio system would intermittently return "Operation Stopped" errors

**Solution**: Implemented robust retry mechanism:
```dart
// Retry logic for iOS "Operation Stopped" errors
bool success = false;
int attempts = 0;
const maxAttempts = 3;  // Increased from 2

while (!success && attempts < maxAttempts) {
  attempts++;
  try {
    await _guidingVoicePlayer.setAsset(selectedFile);
    await _guidingVoicePlayer.setVolume(0.8);
    await _guidingVoicePlayer.play();
    success = true;
    debugPrint('🎵 Playing voice prompt: $selectedFile');
  } catch (e) {
    if (e.toString().contains('Operation Stopped') && attempts < maxAttempts) {
      debugPrint('🔄 Voice prompt retry $attempts: Operation Stopped');
      await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 200));  // Increased from 100ms
      continue;
    } else {
      debugPrint('❌ Error playing voice prompt: $e');
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

**Improvements**:
- Increased maximum retry attempts from 2 to 3
- Extended retry delay from 100ms to 200ms
- Better error logging for debugging

#### Audio Player Resource Management
**Problem**: Multiple audio players conflicting when starting new playback

**Solution**: Added proper cleanup and delays:
```dart
// Stop any current voice playback first to prevent conflicts
try {
  await _guidingVoicePlayer.stop();
} catch (e) {
  // Ignore stop errors, continue with setup
}

// Small delay to let the player reset (iOS specific)
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 50));
```

**Result**: Reduced conflicts between concurrent audio operations.

### 3. File Organization and Mapping

#### Voice File Mapping
**Problem**: Hardcoded file lists didn't match actual asset structure

**Solution**: Accurate mapping for each voice character:
```dart
if (voiceId == 'manu') {
  // Manu voice files
  if (phaseName == 'inhale') {
    availableFiles.addAll(['$assetPath/1.mp3', '$assetPath/2.mp3']);
  } else if (phaseName == 'exhale') {
    availableFiles.addAll(['$assetPath/1.mp3', '$assetPath/2.mp3', '$assetPath/3.mp3']);
  } else if (phaseName == 'pause_after_inhale') {
    // Manu pause_after_inhale: has 1.mp3, 2.mp3, 3.mp3, 4.mp3
    availableFiles.addAll([
      '$assetPath/1.mp3', '$assetPath/2.mp3', '$assetPath/3.mp3', '$assetPath/4.mp3'
    ]);
  } else if (phaseName == 'pause_after_exhale') {
    // Manu pause_after_exhale: has 1.mp3, 2.mp3, 3.mp3, 4.mp3
    availableFiles.addAll([
      '$assetPath/1.mp3', '$assetPath/2.mp3', '$assetPath/3.mp3', '$assetPath/4.mp3'
    ]);
  }
}
```

**Result**: Voice prompts now correctly select from available files for each phase and character.

## Technical Architecture Improvements

### 1. Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Audio failures don't crash the breathing exercise
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive debug information for troubleshooting
- **User Experience**: Silent failures with fallback behavior

### 2. Timing Precision
- **Phase Synchronization**: Audio cues precisely timed with breathing phases
- **Timer-based Stopping**: Instrument cues stop exactly at phase transitions
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper timer cancellation and audio player management

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **iOS Optimizations**: Specific handling for iOS audio system requirements
- **Android Support**: Maintained compatibility with Android audio behavior
- **Web Compatibility**: Preserved web audio functionality

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Reduced Audio Conflicts
**Before**: Multiple simultaneous audio loading attempts causing system overload
**After**: Sequential, managed audio loading with proper cleanup

### 2. Intelligent Retry Logic
**Before**: Immediate failure on first error
**After**: Progressive retry with increasing delays to work with iOS audio system

### 3. Resource Management
**Before**: Audio players left in undefined states
**After**: Explicit state management with proper cleanup

## Testing Results

### Successful Audio Playback
✅ **Voice Prompts**: Both Manu and Andrea voices working correctly
- `🎵 Playing voice prompt: assets/sounds/guiding_voices/manu/inhale/1.mp3`
- `🎵 Playing voice prompt: assets/sounds/guiding_voices/andrea/pause_after_exhale/3.mp3`

✅ **Instrument Cues**: All instrument types functioning properly
- `🎵 Playing instrument cue: assets/sounds/instrument_cues/gong/inhale_gong.mp3`
- `🎵 Playing instrument cue: assets/sounds/instrument_cues/violin/exhale_violin.mp3`

✅ **Background Music**: Seamless music playback and restoration
- `🎵 Playing music: Oceano`
- `🎵 Restored background music: Bosque`

### Error Elimination
