# Version Strategy:
# - Increment patch (1.0.x) for bug fixes and minor changes
# - Increment minor (1.x.0) for new features that don't break existing functionality
# - Increment major (x.0.0) for major redesigns or breaking changes
# - Always increase build number (+1) for each App Store submission

  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/animations/
    - assets/data/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/sounds/music/
    - .env
    # Don't include .env in production builds, it won't be there
    # Instead use --dart-define arguments during build

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
