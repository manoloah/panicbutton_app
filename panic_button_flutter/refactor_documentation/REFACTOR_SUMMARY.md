```

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/services/audio_service.dart`
- Added `pauseAllAudio()` and `resumeAllAudio()` methods
- Enhanced audio providers with automatic settings persistence
- Fixed instrument player lifecycle issues

### 2. `lib/services/breathing_state_persistence_service.dart` (NEW)
- Created dedicated service for session and settings persistence
- Uses SharedPreferences for lightweight storage
- Automatic cleanup of old session data

### 3. `lib/providers/breathing_playback_controller.dart`
- Enhanced pause() to save session state
- Added restoreSessionState() method
- Modified initialize() to prevent unnecessary re-initialization

### 4. `lib/screens/breath_screen.dart`
- Fixed navigation lifecycle with proper pause/resume
- Added automatic restoration of audio settings and session state
- Enhanced audio control during navigation

## Key Fixes Implemented

✅ **Audio Bug**: All audio players now pause instantly on navigation away
✅ **Session Persistence**: Breathing session state saved and restored across navigation  
✅ **Settings Persistence**: Music, voice, and instrument selections persist
✅ **Navigation Lifecycle**: Proper pause on dispose, restore on return
✅ **No Auto-play**: Session returns paused, user must press Play to resume
✅ **Smart Initialization**: Avoids re-init when valid session exists

## Testing Verified
- Navigation away pauses all audio and saves state
- Return to screen restores exact previous state (paused)
- Audio settings persist across navigation
- Pattern changes trigger clean re-initialization
- Works with default and custom breathing patterns
