# panicbutton_app
An app that helps you stop a panic attack and build resilience to stop it from occurring again with breathwork and other mind and body exercises. 

## Recent UI Improvements

The app has undergone several UI enhancements to improve usability across different device sizes:

### Home Screen
- Optimized the main "EMPEZAR" button size for different screen dimensions
- Added responsive scaling for the button based on device width
- Improved text alignment and spacing for the headline text
- Added bottom padding to prevent content overlap with the navbar

### Breathing Exercise Screen
- Redesigned the breathing circle with responsive sizing
- Removed redundant title text for a cleaner, more focused interface
- Repositioned the play/pause button for better visibility
- Implemented a clean, minimal app bar design

### Breathing Pattern Selection
- Reorganized goal categories into a two-row grid layout
- Implemented custom sorting order for breathing goals (Calma, Equilibrio, Enfoque, Energia)
- Improved sheet height constraints for better visibility
- Enhanced card layout for breathing patterns with clearer visual hierarchy

These improvements ensure the app provides a consistent, user-friendly experience across various iOS and Android devices, with special attention to smaller screens like the iPhone SE.
